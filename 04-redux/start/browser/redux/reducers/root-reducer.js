import {SET_LYRICS} from '../../react/constants';

const initialState = { text: '' };

export default function reducer (state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SET_LYRICS:
       return Object.assign({}, state, { text: action.lyric });
    default:
       return state;
  }
}

// Two things to note:
//   1. We use Object.assign to maintain immutability.
//      Since our state only has one key on it, it doesn't matter much, but what if we added more?
//   2. If we receive an action that doesn't have a type we recognize, we return the previous state
